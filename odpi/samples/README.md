This directory contains samples for ODPI-C. All of the executables can be built
using the supplied Makefile. The executables will be placed in the subdirectory
"build" and can be run from there.

See the top level [README](../README.md) for the platforms and compilers that
have been tested and are known to work.

Some samples require the latest Database features.  TestBFILE needs to
write to the physical directory that the database can read from, so it
will generally fail unless it is run on the same machine as the database.

To run the samples:

  - On Linux, set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the location of the Oracle client
    libraries and to the directory containing the ODPI-C library, for
    example:

      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/oracle/instantclient:/opt/oracle/odpi/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

  - Optionally set the environment variables ODPIC_TEST_CONN_USERNAME,
    ODPIC_TEST_CONN_PASSWORD and ODPIC_TEST_CONN_CONNECT_STRING to the
    values for a schema that will be created.

    If you don't set the variables, make sure the schema in the
    Makefile can be dropped and that an empty connect string can be used to
    connect to your database.

  - Optionally set the environment variable ODPIC_TEST_DIR_NAME to a
    string value.  This is the name used in a CREATE DIRECTORY
    command.

  - Run 'make clean' and 'make' to build the samples

  - Run SQL*Plus as SYSDBA and create the sample SQL objects with
    sql/SetupTest.sql.  The syntax is:

      sqlplus / as sysdba @SetupTest <odpicuser> <password> <dirname> <dirpath>

    where the parameters are the names you choose to run the samples.

    The <odpicuser>, <password>, and <dirname> values should match the
    ODPIC_TEST_CONN_USERNAME, ODPIC_TEST_CONN_PASSWORD and
    ODPIC_TEST_DIR_NAME environment variables.  If you did not set
    variables, make sure the values passed to (or defaulting in)
    SetupTest.sql are consistent with the Makefile, and that the
    <dirpath> directory is valid.

    The <dirpath> value is an OS directory that the database server
    can write to.  This is used by TestBFILE.c.

    For example run:

      sqlplus / as sysdba @SetupTest $ODPIC_TEST_CONN_USERNAME $ODPIC_TEST_CONN_PASSWORD $ODPIC_TEST_DIR_NAME /some/shared/directory

  - Change to the 'build' directory and run each sample individually.

  - After running the samples, drop the SQL objects by running the
    script sql/DropTest.sql.  The syntax is:

      sqlplus / as sysdba @DropTest <odpicuser> <dirname>

    For example run:

      sqlplus / as sysdba @DropTest $ODPIC_TEST_CONN_USERNAME $ODPIC_TEST_DIR_NAME
